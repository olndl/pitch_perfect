# PitchPerfect
The simple iOS app that will allow users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. 
This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.

## Main points
 - Buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard
 - The Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView
 - Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code
 - Navigation between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
 - Playing audio files using AVFoundationâ€™s AVAudioEngine class
